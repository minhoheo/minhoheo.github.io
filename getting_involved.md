	<h3 style="text-align: left;">&#127942; <b>Lab Goal</b> </h3>
    <p class="margin-left">
	Our goal is to foster world-class students who can push the boundary of current research fields. To achieve this, we aim to select students with the highest potential and provide the best research environment for their growth.
    </p>
	<ul class="margin-left-list">
        <li>
        Recent Ph.D. alumni have obtained positions as a professor at National Taiwan University, a professor at Yonsei University, and a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley & Stanford.
        </li>
        <li>
        Senior Ph.D. students have presented 5-10 papers at AI top-tier conferences (e.g., ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR) during their Ph.D.
        </li>
        <li>
        Research interns and visiting scholars who gained research experience in our lab have mostly enrolled in top-tier U.S. universities (e.g., MIT, CMU, Stanford) as Master's or Ph.D. students.
        </li>
	</ul>

    <h3 style="text-align: left;">&#128640; <b>Lab Culture</b> </h3>
    <p class="margin-left">
	We pursue a playful lab environment where members can actively discuss research both inside and outside of the lab.
    </p>
	<ul class="margin-left-list">
        <li>
        Interactive: Active discussion between students.
        </li>
        <li>
        Independent: Everyone can lead projects regardless of their position.
        </li>
        <li>
        International: Jointly operating labs at KAIST and the University of Southern California.
        </li>
        <li>
        Internship: Encourage internships at top research labs/companies.
        </li>
	</ul>

	<ul class="margin-left-list">
        <li>
        We also concurrently operate a lab at University of Southern California.
        So, if you join our lab (as a Korean student), you can interact not only with KAIST members but also with students at USC, enabling you to grow more quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
        Additionally, as our laboratory at KAIST is in its early stages, joining us would provide an opportunity to develop a more intimate working relationship.
