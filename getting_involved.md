        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Think deeply about why you want to and have to research. Find your own interests and fields you love to devote yourself to.
            </li>
            <li>
                Consider what the biggest bottleneck in the field you are interested in is. To find the problem, search the space by reading papers and discussing with others.
            </li>
            <li>
                Embrace skill sets in order to solve that problem. It can be math, programming, communication, or anything.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are very good at something (even for League of Legends, for example), find any connection with the desired quality and grow that strong point (communication skill as a team, for example) up to the world-best level.
            </li>
            <li>
                Apply to our group without worrying about starting late or your background.
