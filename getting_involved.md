            <p class="margin-left">
                That said, research is about asking <i>good questions</i>, less about publishing many papers. Starting
                from day 1, we work on developing your research taste through structuring your research direction and
                forming a detailed plan. We especially focus on developing core skills such as discussing high-level
                research topics, posing impactful and interesting questions, and scrutinizing technical details. We aim
                to cultivate a strong philosophy for research. Everything else (e.g., # of publications) then follows
                naturally.
                <br><br>
                The goal of our lab culture is simple - <i>international impact and visibility</i>. We train students to
                seamlessly brainstorm, think, and work with anyone and anywhere in the world.
                To this end, our lab puts a huge amount of emphasis on cultivating the collaborative culture of question
                and discussion, and passion and ambition. The cultural focus of our lab:

                    Flat: No hierarchy, especially between students, similar to the U.S. lab culture (e.g., we call
                    Joseph as Joseph)
                </li>
                <li>
