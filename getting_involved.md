	<h3 style="text-align: left;">&#127942; <b>About Our Lab</b> </h3>
    <p class="margin-left">
	Our goal is to foster independent researchers who are recognized world-wide.
    </p>
	<ul class="margin-left-list">
        <li>
        Recent three Ph.D. alumni have obtained positions as a professor at National Taiwan University, a professor at Yonsei University, and as a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley & Stanford.
        </li>
        <li>
        Senior Ph.D. students have presented 5-10 papers at AI top-tier conferences (e.g., ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR) during their enrollment in our lab.
        </li>
        <li>
        Research interns and visiting scholars who gained research experience in our lab have mostly enrolled in top-tier U.S. universities such as MIT, CMU, and Stanford as Master's or Ph.D. students.
        </li>
        <li>
        During their Ph.D. studies, students can also intern at overseas companies such as Google and Nvidia, as well as engage in visiting scholar program at universities as abroad.
        </li>
	</ul>


    <br>
    <p class="margin-left">
	We pursue a playful lab environment where members can actively discuss research both inside and outside of the lab.
    </p>
	<ul class="margin-left-list">
        <li>
        We also concurrently operate a lab at University of Southern California.
        So, if you join our lab (as a Korean student), you can interact not only with KAIST members but also with students at USC, enabling you to grow more quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
        Additionally, as our laboratory at KAIST is in its early stages, joining us would provide an opportunity to develop a more intimate working relationship.
        </li>
	</ul>
