  <h1>Study Instructions</h1>
  <p style='text-align: left'>
    For this study, the objective is to play through all given tasks in a computer game.
    In each task, you have 5 trials to drag tools onto the screen to make the red ball reach the green target. 
    
    <br><br>
    The first task is a trial task in which you can play around with the tools to see their effects
    on the red ball. We encourage you to play around and get familiar with the tools so that you can solve the rest of the tasks.
    You will not be able to jump around on the tasks, they must be completed in the order given. Once you solve 
    a task, you can click the next button to move onto the next trial or task.

    <br><br>
    <b>Please first complete the personality quiz below. Then, proceed to view the game instruction video, look through and understand the tools,
      and finally play the game!
    Once the last task is solved, you are free to leave the study.</b>
