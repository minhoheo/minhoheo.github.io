      <p>
      The Cognitive Learning for Vision and Robotics lab (CLVR) at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) is led by Professor Joseph J. Lim (임재환). Our goal is to develop intelligent systems that are capable of not only perceiving the world but also reasoning and interacting with it. We are interested in building a cognitive model that can learn to manipulate symbols and make plausible decisions given multi-modal data from the surroundings. Especially, we have focused on robot learning and program synthesis, and other interesting topics.

      <p>
      Our research spans topics, including cognitive model, computer vision, robot learning, symbolic representation, reasoning, and any other interesting topics, as below:
